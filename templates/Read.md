## Directory Structure
- `gpus/` — GPU power delivery, VRAM diagnostics, core rework, and telemetry logs.
- `motherboards/` — Board-level triage, rail diagnosis, and component replacement.
- `consoles/` — Console hardware repairs, HDMI/power IC replacement, and reflows.
- `other/` — Peripheral, PSU, and general compute hardware fixes.
- `templates/` — Master case file schema and reporting structure.

## Workflow
Generate a new log entry via CLI:
```bash
